5. allow different users to comment on equips x
	. develop simulation system +3 
7. Add links at top to: Gear index Page (shows ALL gears + who made), User Page (shows all created gears by user)


TODO LIST:
- simulation system

- user show page should list prominent equip info and link_to x 
- Gear index page should list prominent equip info and link_to and made to look nicer x
- Refactor CSS for gear/new x
- EDIT/UPDATE/DELETE for gear X


Nice to Have:

- user visits Show page for gear
- clicks on Simulate gear
	- 

- e7 equipment rolling table
